# Make Money (v2+, final)

~~Proper standard is to use the same repository across versions but it's so mangled I may as well create a new one~~

~~In my defence, it was my first time using GitHub and now I have a better idea of project structure~~

Consider Make Money officially dead. The last time I worked on this was over a year ago, and I could probably do better with the knowledge I have now.
